# Help-a-friend
A set of scripts to help a friend with it s work, it basicaly takes a bunch of data and process it in a list and then makes some calculations 


My friend works in logistic, he needed something to make it easier to plan the routes for all the transports, this takes a bunch of raw html code that he copies directly 
from the company site and places it in the folders as needed, the scripts are sorting the stuff and find the necesary data that gets saved , and then that stuff get s to
be sorted and then a simple sum function on them and presto, from 30 minutes to 5 clicks and a F5.
